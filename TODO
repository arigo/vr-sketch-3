- add some form of tutorials how to use it
- grouping feature
- loading/saving of sketchup (.skp) files

- test out bugs (there are some), improve py.test testing, and reduce
  the complexity of computations (FPS tends to drop after making models with a few dozen faces)
  
- there's "copy-pasting" which would be convenient
- finish Push/pull
- maybe a Push/pull operation that also works on edges, so that you can
  extend an edge into a square face

- multiplayer

- also, middle button should hide the menu
- sometimes, the pencil cursor is angled just wrong and it is almost
  completely hidden inside the geometry
- allow coloring the faces
